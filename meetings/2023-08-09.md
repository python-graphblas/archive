# Meeting notes 2023-08-09

Attendees: ErikW, JimK, PaulN, William

Paul: we need marketing and advocacy:
- blog posts
  - start simple: BFS, SSSP, intro to GraphBLAS
  - benchmarks compare to other libraries
  - show examples that connect to common use cases
  - GNNs, DNNs, anime, like PyTorch stuff
  - adopting GraphBLAS in CVXPY? ;)
  - PyOpenSci would like a simple blog post
  - networkx dispatching example
  - recommender systems
  - see example notebooks in networkx, cugraph, grblas-recipes
  - compare/contrast to scipy.sparse, sparse data that is not graph
  - GraphBLAS implementation of CG
  - Nixtla wanted to speed up sparse operations
- white papers, JOSS paper, conference paper
- videos

Paul: is there random sampling in GraphBLAS
  - See: A.ss.selectk("random", k)

William: looking into using GraphBLAS in CVXPY
  - See: A.ss.reshape, A.ss.flatten, gb.ss.concat
  - Identity: Vector.from_scalar(1, n).diag()

Short term goals:
- Release `python-graphblas` that support SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS 8
  - need to document JIT
  - PR is in progress
  - anything else?
- Update `graphblas-algorithms` to support NetworkX 3.2
  - new `convert_from_nx` coming
  - maybe new `can_run`
  - PR is in progress (but outdated)
- drop Python 3.8 support
  - https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas/wiki/Drop-support-of-old-Python-version
  - any volunteers? ;) (is the documentation sufficient?)
