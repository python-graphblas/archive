Present: Erik, Sultan

Agenda:

- news & announcements:
    - PyCon: poster accepted, talk rejected
    - NumFOCUS affiliate application submitted
    - https://www.pyopensci.org - submit for peer review?
- priority setting:
    - Automatic wheel building for `python-suitesparse-graphblas`
        - Linux, Windows, MacOS
        - using cibuildwheel; maybe look into scikit-build?
    - Applications/use in other libraries
        - scikit-learn, scikit-image, QuTiP, conda-forge, etc.
        - https://github.com/scientific-python/scientific-python.org-blobs/tree/main/summits/sparse/meeting1
    - PageRank example/benchmark with `dask-graphblas`
        - Complete rename to `dask-graphblas`
        - Release if "good enough" to run PageRank (we can update tests later)
    - graphblas-algorithm... (shortest paths? teaching others)
    - Better UDTs/UDFs: https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas/discussions/298
    - Documentation/tutorial 
    - See also: https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas/issues/360
- discussion on suitesparse-vanilla
- Logo: https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas/issues/171
- live coding date set for Jan 30
- 10 minutes to python-graphblas
- numpy-based POC:
    - There perhaps could be a python backend using numba/sparse?
- Compare sparse-dense benchmarks from `tabmat`
